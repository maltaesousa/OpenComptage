** Use cases
*** UC1 Visualisation of existing measure campaigns
    The user requests to see the past measure campaigns. He can filter the
    results by date, type of measure and type of device. The campaigns are
    showed as colored road segments for the temporary measure and as a point for
    the permanent measures. If the measure campaign was during a special event
    or a non working days, an information is showed.
    * Input:
      * date from
      * date to
      * type of measure
      * type of device
    * Output: 
      - map
*** UC2 Create device configuration
    The user selects the tool to create a new device configuration. He clicks on
    the map to define the location and he sets all the details of the measure
    and the used device in the showed form. Once the details are inserted, he
    is informed if there are some issues (e.g. non-working days) and he can
    download the configuration file to be used into the measure machine.
    - Input:
      - measure details
      - device details
    - Output:
      - configuration file
*** UC3 Create measure plan
    The user selects the tool to create a measure plan. He is asked to select
    the desired measures and then he can download the measure plan with the
    picture and the map of the location
    - Input: 
      - selection of measure points
    - Output:
      - plan file with map
*** UC4 Insert device number
    The user selects an existing measure on the map and can edit the details and
    (e.g. insert the device number).
    - Input:
      - device number
    - Output:
      - 
*** UC5 Import measure data
    The user selects the tool to import the measure data. He can select one or
    more files from the file system. Only the data of the measure days are
    imported. After the import, the user sees a chart of the imported data and
    can decide if he wants to finalize the import or abort it.
    - Input:
      - data files
    - Output:
      - chart of measures
*** UC6 Create report
    The user selects the tool to create a report. He define the details of the
    report he wants to export and he can download the report. 
    - Input:
      - measure id
    - Output:
      - report PDF
*** UC7 Validate report
    The user selects the tool to validate the report. He can select if the
    report is accepted or not.
    - Input:
      - report validation
    - Output:
      - 
*** UC8 Validate measure
    The user (trafic engineer) opens the attribute table of the measures and sets
    the validity flag of the data he wants to validate.
    - Input:
      - Validity state
    - Output:
      - 
*** UC9 Import non-working days
    The user selects the tool to insert the non-working days. He can select a
    ics file from the file system.  
    - Input:
      - ics file
    - Output:
      - 
** Functional requirements
   Note:
   - create an interface to set the "tronçon" details (e.g. picture, ...) 
   - log all modification of the data, logging the timestamp and the windows user.
** Non-functional requirements
