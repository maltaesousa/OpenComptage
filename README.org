** Use cases
*** UC1 Visualisation of existing measure campaigns
    The user requests to see the past measure campaigns. He can filter the
    results by date, type of measure and type of device. The campaigns are
    showed as colored road segments for the temporary measure and as a point for
    the permanent measures. If the measure campaign was during a special event
    or a holidays, an information is showed.
    * Input:
      * date from
      * date to
      * type of measure
      * type of device
    * Output: 
      - map
*** UC2 Create device configuration
    The user selects the tool to create a new device configuration. He clicks on
    the map to define the location and he sets all the details of the measure campaign
    and the used device in the showed form. Once the details are inserted, he
    is informed if there are some issues (e.g. non-working days) and he can
    download the configuration file to be used into the measure machine.

      - measure details
      - device details
    - Output:
      - configuration file

*** UC5 Import measure data
    The user selects the tool to import the measure data. He can select one or

    the validity flag of the data he wants to validate.
    - Input:
      - Validity state
    - Output:
      - 
*** UC8 Import non-working days
    The user selects the tool to insert the non-working days. He can select a
    ics file from the file system.  
    - Input:

      The customer wants to be able to write himself the modification to the
      product to support another measure device type.
    - Fit Criteria
      To support a new measure device, it's enough to create a new class, well
      documented.
** Data model
   The data model has been created to easily allow to add functionality to the product
   e.g. adding new vehicle classes and to be as simple as possible and easily
   usable into QGIS. It is flexible enough to support natively all the current
   special cases without write special management code.

*** Tables
**** measurement
     This table contains the info about the imported data into the system. A row
     corresponds to an import from an ASCII file and all the fields come from the
     ASCII file.
     
     Open points:
     - [ ] what is the meaning of the prunit field
     - [ ] what is the meaning of the gridref field
**** data_int_2
     This table contains the data from the INT-2 ASCII files. Each data row of
     the ASCII file corresponds to a row of the table.
     - Type can be LEN, CLS, SPD, DRN
     
     Open points:
     - [ ] fields like peaktime, peakint, lenbins etc, are needed?
**** data_vbv_1
     This table contains the data from the VBV-1 ASCII files. Each data row of
     the ASCII file corresponds to a row of the table.
**** campaign
     This table contains the info about the measure campaigns. Each record
     corresponds to a measure campaign.
**** section
     This table contains the street sections (/tronçons/). The primary key is the
     8 digit segment code.  

     Open points:
     - [ ] meaning and type of road, way, pr, direction_1, direction_2?
**** measure_place
     This table contains all the measure places, permanents and
     temporaries. This table has a relation 1-to-many (1-to-2 for temporary
     places) with measure_place_configuration table.  The table contains a
     geometry point filed. This field is used only for the permanent measure places. 
**** measure_place_configuration
     This table contains the configurations for the measure place. In fact
     relates a section direction with a device and a channel. It allows to
     manage the special cases and the "super-special" case.
**** special_dates
     This table contains the dates of holidays, school vacations and similar.
*** Views
**** Temporary measure place
**** Permanent measure place
* deadlines
  - 15.08 Neuchâtel sends info about tables and a dump of the actual postgres db
  - 24.08 We send the database model
  - 06.09 Neuchâtel vaidate the database model
  - 05.10 13:00 meeting (perhaps online) to present the prototype
  - 14.11 13:00 meeting 
* Notes
** Develop the plugin with TDD. 
** Is it possible to use SQLAlchemy into the plugin without installing external tools?
   I think yes, because is a simply pip install. For Postgis there is geoalchemy
   https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
*** Create ER diagram from sqlalchemy
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44981986/sqlalchemy-er-diagram-in-python-3
** Use Denis's CI integration for QGIS 
   Deploy automatically a new QGIS plugin to download for each new tag
** Use the strategy design pattern
   To be able to use different algorithms to create configuration files and use
   different algorithms to import data from different sources.
** Data model notes
   - Which approach use to the measure tables.
     - 2 tables (int and vbv) with all the data
       pros
       - simple
       cons
       - duplicated columns
       - maybe more difficult to expand in the future if there is a new ASCII
         data format
     - a table measure with the common data and 2 tables (int and vbv) that
       extend the measure table
       pros
       - similar to what I do with the software
       - logical structure
       cons
       - it is a problem to manage ineritance in postgres? And in qgis? 
     - A single table, with common data as columns and other data as external
       fields-value 
       pros
       - only one table
       cons
       - complex to manage, search into the data, etc.
     - Only 1 table with all the columns and views to show only the subset of
       desired data instead of inheritance
   - The pictures can be in the tronçon table? And how to manage the fixes
     points pictures?
   - Define the temporary measure point as a separate table related 1-1 with the
     tronçon.
* Email for Pierre 21-08-2018
  Ciao Pierre, 
  sto analizzando i vari dati in mio possesso e ho creato una prima versione del
  data model. 
  
  Ci sono ancora alcuni punti che non sono ancora completamente definiti e
  necessiteranno probabilmente di ulteriori correzioni:
  - I campi della tabella ~section~ (relativa ai /tronçons/), da sistemare in in
    base alle descrizioni della attuale banca dati.
  - Non è chiaro il significato di alcuni valori contenuti nell'intestazione dei
    file ASCII ad esempio prunit, gridref, peaktime, lenbins.

  Per il resto, il modello dovrebbe consentire di creare in maniera abbastanza
  semplice in QGIS gli use case definiti per il progetto e permettere di gestire
  nativamente tutti i casi speciali.
