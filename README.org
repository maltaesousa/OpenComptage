* Tests
  Functional tests are run inside a Docker container. The Docker container is
  based on Ubuntu 18.04 with QGIS installed. The ~run_test.sh~ script, will launch
  QGIS without welcome messages & co. and run into QGIS the ~test.py~ python
  script contained into the shared volume ~.docker/tests/~. After a wait of 10s, a
  screenshot of the virtual framebuffer is taken, and stored into the shared
  volume as ~screenshot.png~, and the docker terminates.  

  To run the tests, go to the main directory of the project and do
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    scripts/run_docker_test.sh
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  To rebuild the docker, e.g. when the run_test.sh script is modified
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml build
  #+END_SRC
